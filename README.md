## CSCE A470 Capstone Project
### Denaina Place Names App  
##### Alfred Soriano, Chris Yang, Jiwon Bae  

This interactive map and web application is aimed to provide users with historical and cultural information about Dena’ina places within Anchorage and the greater southcentral area, for the heritage and culture revitalization in Alaska. This project will focus specifically on the Upper Cook Inlet Dena’ina region, with the target dialect of the Upper Cook Inlet Dena’ina Dene.

The clients for this project are local cultural heritage initiative Professors from the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) named Dr. Maria Williams and Dr. Jessica Ross. Working alongside our clients will be technical mentor Dr. Pradeeban Kathiravelu.

The goal of this project focuses on providing an accessible and user-friendly experience to learn about the Dena’ina place names and their historical significance. As such, the project aims to be informative and educational, rather than merely providing functionalities. The scope of this project includes designing and developing a web application, curating content, and integrating interactive features that display historical information based on historical or cultural locations.
